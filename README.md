# CREATIVE DESIGN 2022

## Tri Tower

Overall this project was pretty intriguing since I have never worked with this kind of materials before. My process started with initial sketches on paint, but due to the time limit imposed upon students I had minimal time to actually design it before starting the implementation process. I found out that coffee in the morning hindered my progress on the implementation since my hands were a little bit shaky so it was hard to control the spaghetti. Initially I used office tape but noticed it was not good enough for this project and settled with masking tape.

Things that did not work so well were the initial tape choices, initial design wasn't feasible to be produced within the time limits. Things that worked were the final choice of the tape and the sturdiness of the tower, it has now stood on my counter for multiple days without falling apart. 

I did not have time to receive feedback from others on this exercise so I asked one of my course mates after and he told me that the design looked a lot similar to the other ones he had seen and that it looked very sturdy and rigid. 

Things that could be improved are the design of the tower and it could be taped in a more fashionable way to give it a better look.

I think the whole idea around prototyping with just tape and spaghetti strands was novel in my opinion. I also managed to use the tape as a part of the structure of the tower.

Well the whole purpose was to build a tower with minimal materials and I managed to do that so this tower fulfills the requirements imposed upon us, the students. I mentioned in the above paragraph what makes this prototype creative and stand out from the others. But TLDR the tower is very sturdy, tall and the tape as a part of the structure was a good touch.
