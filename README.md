# CREATIVE DESIGN 2022

## EXERCISE 1: Tri Tower

Overall this project was pretty intriguing since I have never worked with this kind of materials before. My process started with initial sketches on paint, but due to the time limit imposed upon students I had minimal time to actually design it before starting the implementation process. I found out that coffee in the morning hindered my progress on the implementation since my hands were a little bit shaky so it was hard to control the spaghetti. Initially I used office tape but noticed it was not good enough for this project and settled with masking tape.

Things that did not work so well were the initial tape choices, initial design wasn't feasible to be produced within the time limits. Things that worked were the final choice of the tape and the sturdiness of the tower, it has now stood on my counter for multiple days without falling apart. 

I did not have time to receive feedback from others on this exercise so I asked one of my course mates after and he told me that the design looked a lot similar to the other ones he had seen and that it looked very sturdy and rigid. 

Things that could be improved are the design of the tower and it could be taped in a more fashionable way to give it a better look.

I think the whole idea around prototyping with just tape and spaghetti strands was novel in my opinion. I also managed to use the tape as a part of the structure of the tower.

Well the whole purpose was to build a tower with minimal materials and I managed to do that so this tower fulfills the requirements imposed upon us, the students. I mentioned in the above paragraph what makes this prototype creative and stand out from the others. But TLDR the tower is very sturdy, tall and the tape as a part of the structure was a good touch.

## EXERCISE 2: Concept generation

The idea generation process started out by listing possible ideas for the exercise. The main material this time was clothing pegs. I started the idea creation process by just writing up whatever came to my mind at the moment. I managed to come up with 12 different ideas. One idea that a fellow student came up with was using clothes pegs as fussball players which really stood out for me and I liked that idea a lot. In the end I decided to go with one of my own ideas, a car phone holder using two different clothing pegs. The car phone holder would attach to the air vent via one clothing peg and then another one would be attached to it to hold the actual phone.

The next step was to start sketching a prototype for the idea, I created 3 different viewpoints one from the car interior viewpoint, one from front view of the air vent and one from the side view of the air vent. Due to the simplicity of the sketch I decided to add a car charger cell to the back of the phone holding peg. The cell could be attached with glue and it would magnetically connect to the phone so the user could charge their phone while driving. In the end the prototype looked a lot like a makeshift version of todays car phone holders.

One problem I noticed during the sketching process was that it would be a very static phone holder i.e. it couldn't rotate the phone and the phone would always be in a side viewpoint compared to the driver. One solution to this problem would be to modify the peg that is holding the phone so that it could rotate 90 degrees and thus it could lay against the air vent offering more support. Another clothing peg could be used to hold a cable close to the phone holder so the charging cell could be charged. This would also allow directly charging the mobile device.

Another problem would be how durable would the actual prototype be? Without modifying the pegs at all I do not think the prototype could hold larger devices with just two clothes pegs. A solution for this would be to modify the pegs as said before and/or add more pegs to the structure so that two pegs would be holding the device and two pegs would then hold those pegs against the air vent.

Overall I am proud of the idea I came up and received positive feedback from one of my peers, so much so that they also liked the idea so much that they also started sketching a prototype of it!

During the last part of the exercise we had to create a mindmap of mosquitoes. I settled for 6 different main categories: annoying, southern countries, northern countries, different species, biological weapons can transfer pollen and food. As a Finn I hate mosquitoes and they ruin our cottage trips so I am glad there are repellants for them, but in this mindmap I tried to find benefits of having mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are a good food source for the natures economy.
