# CREATIVE DESIGN 2022

## EXERCISE 1: Tri Tower

Overall this project was pretty intriguing since I have never worked with this kind of materials before. My process started with initial sketches on paint, but due to the time limit imposed upon students I had minimal time to actually design it before starting the implementation process. I found out that coffee in the morning hindered my progress on the implementation since my hands were a little bit shaky so it was hard to control the spaghetti. Initially I used office tape but noticed it was not good enough for this project and settled with masking tape.

Things that did not work so well were the initial tape choices, initial design wasn't feasible to be produced within the time limits. Things that worked were the final choice of the tape and the sturdiness of the tower, it has now stood on my counter for multiple days without falling apart. 

I did not have time to receive feedback from others on this exercise so I asked one of my course mates after and he told me that the design looked a lot similar to the other ones he had seen and that it looked very sturdy and rigid. 

Things that could be improved are the design of the tower and it could be taped in a more fashionable way to give it a better look.

I think the whole idea around prototyping with just tape and spaghetti strands was novel in my opinion. I also managed to use the tape as a part of the structure of the tower.

Well the whole purpose was to build a tower with minimal materials and I managed to do that so this tower fulfills the requirements imposed upon us, the students. I mentioned in the above paragraph what makes this prototype creative and stand out from the others. But TLDR the tower is very sturdy, tall and the tape as a part of the structure was a good touch.

## EXERCISE 2: Concept generation

The idea generation process started out by listing possible ideas for the exercise. The main material this time was clothing pegs. I started the idea creation process by just writing up whatever came to my mind at the moment. I managed to come up with 12 different ideas. One idea that a fellow student came up with was using clothes pegs as fussball players which really stood out for me and I liked that idea a lot. In the end I decided to go with one of my own ideas, a car phone holder using two different clothing pegs. The car phone holder would attach to the air vent via one clothing peg and then another one would be attached to it to hold the actual phone.

The next step was to start sketching a prototype for the idea, I created 3 different viewpoints one from the car interior viewpoint, one from front view of the air vent and one from the side view of the air vent. Due to the simplicity of the sketch I decided to add a car charger cell to the back of the phone holding peg. The cell could be attached with glue and it would magnetically connect to the phone so the user could charge their phone while driving. In the end the prototype looked a lot like a makeshift version of todays car phone holders.

One problem I noticed during the sketching process was that it would be a very static phone holder i.e. it couldn't rotate the phone and the phone would always be in a side viewpoint compared to the driver. One solution to this problem would be to modify the peg that is holding the phone so that it could rotate 90 degrees and thus it could lay against the air vent offering more support. Another clothing peg could be used to hold a cable close to the phone holder so the charging cell could be charged. This would also allow directly charging the mobile device.

Another problem would be how durable would the actual prototype be? Without modifying the pegs at all I do not think the prototype could hold larger devices with just two clothes pegs. A solution for this would be to modify the pegs as said before and/or add more pegs to the structure so that two pegs would be holding the device and two pegs would then hold those pegs against the air vent.

Overall I am proud of the idea I came up and received positive feedback from one of my peers, so much so that they also liked the idea so much that they also started sketching a prototype of it!

The idea and prototype make it fitting to the purpose because they can do the job as a makeshift phone holder, it is creative because it saves money and normally people wouldn't think about using clothing pegs in this way. This is also why the idea is novel.

During the last part of the exercise we had to create a mindmap of mosquitoes. I settled for 6 different main categories: annoying, southern countries, northern countries, different species, biological weapons can transfer pollen and food. As a Finn I hate mosquitoes and they ruin our cottage trips so I am glad there are repellants for them, but in this mindmap I tried to find benefits of having mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are a good food source for the natures economy.

## EXERCISE 3: Wallet 

I was in the Thursday's group for this exercise since I couldn't make it to the exercise on Friday. This exercise began by first sketching our own
ideas of ideal wallets. For me an ideal wallet has to bee compact, have an easy way to grab all the necessary things and it has an easy way to
show your ID in case you need to. This means that there should be separate spaces for small amount of cash, ID spot and a card holder.
I really like the design of today's card holder wallets.

Then we had interviews with our partner who was decided on random. We interviewed each other to figure out what kind of things we like
in our ideal wallets and taked notes on these.

My partners ideal wallet needs to:
  - Have a coin space 
  - Needs to be practical, if it works dont fix it.
  - Minimal size
  - No need to be decorated
  - He likes the no-nonsense design of Iphones
  - Perhaps a modular wallet? Where you could take it apart for example remove coin purse and only take card holder
  - Coin module for each type of coin?

Then we had to guess what our partner tried to achieve with his ideal wallet:
  - The main point is that it needs to be practical, not pretty with a space for coins.
  - TLDR: coins, small, practical

Insights:
  Having different coins organized is difficult while keeping the size minimal

Take a stand with a POV:

Partner needs a way to store coins, cards, bills all in a small wallet, because it would help him keep all the currency with him at all times.

After these steps it was time to sketch our test designs, I came up with two with taxi coin holders on the side, and two with coin purses integrated the last one was a wallet with two modules one for cards and bills one for coins.

Then we gave our feedback on these test designs to eachother and the feedback I receivec was:
  - Coins horizontally or vertically is not practical because the wallet becomes wider
  - Liked the 3rd and 5th ones.
  - The coin purse separately was a good idea
  - ID separately would be nice (it would be easier to show it at cashier etc.)
  - zipper could be wider
 
 After this it was time to sketch the final design for this exercise

Now it was finally time to start prototyping the actual test model. One problem I encountered was that I didnt have a spare zipper or a way to
integrate it into the design so I scratched that out and made the coin holder more cubical.

I was kinda let down at what I could scratch together in the end. It was way off the actual design, but for my defense it was hard to
create one with the cardboard, tape, glue etc. that I had available.


## EXERCISE 4: Idea generation process

In this exercise we had to use two different methods of idea creation. The methods were SCAMPER and Morphological analysis. These methods
were completely new to me and I had never even used anything similar prior.
SCAMPER method consisted of Substution, Combining, Adapting, Modifying, Putting to another use, Eliminating and Reversing.
For me the easiest ones were the First three and Putting to another use. The rest of the methods required me to think a bit more
before I understood the assignment. In my opinion Substitution provided the most viable idea from my generation process.
I think using AI in trash cans could be used in the development of future trash cans. Thinking out loud I think I kind of run
out of creativity at the end and seemed to be just reusing my prior ideas in new ways, but I also think this is kind of part
of the process.

The second method, Morphological analysis was confusing for me at first, but thanks to the lecture notes I managed to do it.
It basically consisted of taking the problems and critical functions apart and thinking of each of them separately. For example
in a car you could think of the wheels, control system, frame, power usage and safety. Our task was to think about a public
transportation for 2 people. At first it was difficult of me to separate all the functions of the property, but after a bit of
thinking I think I came to a good end and I am proud of the results I achieved.

In the exercise laboratory session we we're assigned in a trio. I knew the other person, but the other one was completely new to me.
At the end of the day I really liked this kind of setting where we could also meet other fellow students that we had never seen
before and our third guy was a really nice guy. Together we really managed to shine in the exercise and I had a lot of fun doing it.
I definitely think these idea generation processes are better to be done as a team than as an individual, because you get to see
the contrast of ideas and the other people are also generating different ideas that we could combine and use together giving us a 
completely new creative perspective. This was definitely the most fun exercise so far for me.

# EXERCISE 5

In this exercise we were tasked with generating ideas on two different idea generation methods. The first one was Fishbone Diagram method. The general idea of this method is to identify problem's root causes for further analysis and brainstorm the causes of these problems to finally implement ideas. The second method was thematic relations method which uses keywords to create ideas based on situation, functions, daily life and new idea. I forgot to include the 4th slide in my pre assignment return. Basically the whole idea is to pair keywords in different methods to generate further ideas.

The first one was fairly straightforward and I didn't struggle on it that much, since it seemed familiar to the previous idea generation processes I have used in my life. It also corresponded the most the general problem solving idea when debugging code or creating code. Although I did seem to misunderstand where the core problems were supposed to be laid out in the plan.

The second one was where I struggled a lot, I didn't quite understand how to use the keywords to generate ideas in new situations so it took me a while to actually get them done. After about an hour to two hours of work I did manage to finally create the ideas and started to understand this method.

After the individual preassignment submits were done we had a in-person exercise in teams of two to three using these methods. This was again the most fun because we got to interact with out fellow students to understand these methods better!
